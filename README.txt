- it is assumed that when the user is asked to input numbers for how tall and wide
  they'd like the maze to be that they choose only integers and that those integers are ≥ 5 but ≤ 20
- No known bugs.
- to run: input 'java MyMaze' in the command line. no need to compile.

Notice: The only code that I had created was the MyMaze.java file, everything else was provided to me.
